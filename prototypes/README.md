# Prototypes isolation and deploy

This folder contains isolated prototype projects:

- `prototypes/polar-sound/index.html`
- `prototypes/polar-sound/` (full Polar flow with `option-*` variants and local `img/`)

> **Note:** The Candlelight prototypes (Queen & Coldplay) have been moved to a separate repo:
> [candlelight_flows](https://github.com/emilianoechevarriafever/candlelight_flows)

## Suggested Vercel split

Create separate Vercel projects from the same repository:

1. Polar Sound flow
   - Root Directory: `prototypes/polar-sound`

Recommended settings:

- Framework Preset: `Other`
- Build Command: empty
- Output Directory: empty
